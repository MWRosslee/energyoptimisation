# Step 1: Gather Data
# Retrieve data from the inverter and weather history details

# Sample data for demonstration purposes
inverter_data = {
    'power_generation': 5000,  # Power generation in watts
    'battery_level': 70,  # Battery level in percentage
    'grid_connected': True  # Grid connection status
}

weather_data = {
    'sunlight_hours': 8,  # Average sunlight hours
    'cloud_cover': 0.3,  # Cloud cover percentage
    'rainfall': 0.1  # Rainfall amount in inches
}

# Step 2: Calculate Available Sunlight Hours
# Adjust the average sunlight hours based on cloud cover and rainfall

adjusted_sunlight_hours = weather_data['sunlight_hours'] * (1 - weather_data['cloud_cover']) * (1 - weather_data['rainfall'])

# Step 3: Determine Power Generation Capacity
# Adjust the expected power generation capacity based on cloud cover and rainfall

adjusted_power_generation = inverter_data['power_generation'] * (1 - weather_data['cloud_cover']) * (1 - weather_data['rainfall'])

# Step 4: Evaluate Charging from the Grid
if inverter_data['grid_connected']:
    charging_duration = inverter_data['power_generation'] / 1000  # Assuming charging efficiency is 1000 watts per hour
    if charging_duration >= adjusted_power_generation:
        print("Charging duration is appropriate.")
    else:
        print("Charging duration could be optimized.")

# Step 5: Evaluate Running Off Battery Power
if inverter_data['battery_level'] > 0:
    if inverter_data['battery_level'] >= adjusted_power_generation:
        print("Battery level is sufficient.")
    else:
        print("Battery level could be optimized.")

# Step 6: Evaluate Running from the Grid
if not inverter_data['grid_connected']:
    power_consumption = inverter_data['power_generation']
    if power_consumption <= adjusted_power_generation:
        print("Power consumption is efficient.")
    else:
        print("Power consumption could be optimized.")

# Step 7: Conclusion and Recommendations
# Summarize the evaluation results and provide recommendations based on the scenarios

print("Evaluation Results:")
print("-" * 20)
print(f"Adjusted Sunlight Hours: {adjusted_sunlight_hours}")
print(f"Adjusted Power Generation Capacity: {adjusted_power_generation}")
print("-" * 20)
print("Recommendations:")
# Add your recommendations based on the evaluation results
