Solar Setting Evaluation Script

Introduction:
This script will help evaluate the current settings of a solar system, considering various factors such as sunlight hours, cloud cover, rainfall, and data from the inverter and weather history. The evaluation will focus on three scenarios: charging from the grid, running off battery power, and relying solely on the grid.

Step 1: Gather Data
- Retrieve data from the inverter, including power generation, battery level, and grid connection status.
- Obtain weather history details, including sunlight hours, cloud cover, and rainfall.

Step 2: Calculate Available Sunlight Hours
- Determine the average sunlight hours for the current day based on historical data.
- Adjust the value considering the current cloud cover and rainfall.

Step 3: Determine Power Generation Capacity
- Calculate the expected power generation capacity of the solar system based on available sunlight hours.
- Adjust the value considering the current cloud cover and rainfall.

Step 4: Evaluate Charging from the Grid
- Check if the solar system is currently charging from the grid.
- If yes, evaluate the charging duration and compare it with the expected power generation capacity.
- Provide feedback on whether the charging duration is appropriate or if it could be optimized.

Step 5: Evaluate Running Off Battery Power
- Check if the solar system is currently running off battery power.
- If yes, evaluate the battery level and compare it with the expected power generation capacity.
- Provide feedback on whether the battery level is sufficient or if it could be optimized.

Step 6: Evaluate Running from the Grid
- Check if the solar system is currently solely running from the grid.
- If yes, evaluate the power consumption and compare it with the expected power generation capacity.
- Provide feedback on whether the power consumption is efficient or if adjustments should be made.

Step 7: Conclusion and Recommendations
- Summarize the evaluation results for each scenario (charging from the grid, running off battery power, running from the grid).
- Provide recommendations on optimizing the solar system settings based on the evaluation results and historical data.

Note: This script provides a general framework for evaluating solar system settings. The implementation may vary depending on the specific hardware, data sources, and programming language being used.

Remember to regularly update the historical data and weather details to ensure accurate evaluations.
